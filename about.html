                <p class="md-heading ">
                    Online National Conference on SUSTAINABLE MATERIAL AND PRACTICES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT (SMPID-2020) focuses on emerging research and developments in infrastructure with emphasis on eco-friendly materials and practices. The infrastructures,
                    which are being constructed today, will shape our lives tomorrow. The complex and diverse nature of the impacts due to climate change / weather extremes on civil infrastructures can be seen in our roadways, railways, bridges, flyovers,
                    harbours, buildings etc. Extreme summer temperatures, flash floods, and rising numbers of freeze-thaw cycles pose challenges for civil infrastructure and can endanger public safety. Thus, civil infrastructures require constant attention,
                    maintenance, and upgradation. Use of sustainable resources and design practices in various infrastructural sectors is the key to respond the impending crisis. Structural, geotechnical, environmental aspects along with transportation
                    networks and water resources management are critical areas to be considered. SMPID-2020 provides a forum for the dissemination of latest technical information, publication of the highquality research results and debate on the new
                    trends in the area of infrastructure with lower ecological footprint.
